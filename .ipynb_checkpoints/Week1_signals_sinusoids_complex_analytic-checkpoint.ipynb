The raw signals recorded by a radar almost always need to be processed in some way to generate a useful data product. The intended objective of these notebooks is to help people 1) learn and get comfortable with some of the tools and terminology that are integral to processing radar signals, and 2) understand how many of the end user radar datasets that we work with on a daily basis came to be. </p>\n",
